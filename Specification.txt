Create an application

Add an image (you can show a static image here)
Add a ‘Count’ label which shows a count.
Add a ‘Increment’ button. 
    Tapping on the button should increase the count shown by the label by 1.
Tapping on the main view (i.e. outside the button / label / image) should decrease the count shown by the label by 1.

The background color for the custom view should change as follows (Optional - animate this color change):
    Green if the count is positive
    Red if the count is negative
    White if the count is 0

Add a switch which can enable / disable the ‘Increment’ button 
Add a slider which goes from 0 to 1. The opacity of the image should change as per this slider.
